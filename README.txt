Hey guys, all code has been moved into the git repo ~/INSuRE on both machines. Here's a procedure to use to make sure we don't overwrite each other's code:

Open terminal and navigate to the INSuRE directory (cd ~/INSuRE)
Grab the latest code from the repository(git pull)
Make code changes and test
If adding or deleting files, make sure to include them in the next commit(git add *)
Complete commit (git commit -m "Type a comment on the changes you made --<name>)
Push that commit to the repo(git push)
